First thing:
# I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR CAMPAIGNS WHEN USING THIS TAG, CHECK THE LICENSE FILE!

### What is this about?
This is a tag for sending NON offline conversions from your website back to Bing/Microsoft Ads system, using Google Tag Manager Server-side.

### Why should I use it?
- If you want to get rid of the UET tag in your website to boost page speed.
- If you want to have more control of the data being sent back to Bing/Microsoft for some reason
- If you want to make your tag implementation faster

### How reliable is it?
Even though I have tested it, have in mind that this tag was created using information gathered from outdated sources and also from my own experince. It may not behave correctly for your use case or Bing may change something after its release, so, be sure to test it before going full throttle with your campaigns. 

### How to use it?
1. Search for this tag inside the Communit Template Gallery in your Google Tag Manager
2. Install it
3. Create a tag
4. Set the parameters. You can leave the non-required parameters as it is, they will default to the information from the event data, or you can set them manually, if you do, they will ignore the default event data.

One consideration: the tag may not be able to read or create the _uetmsclkid cookie from the page if a custom domain is not set the for tracking server. In that case you can pass the parameters manually.
